# Reed_solomon-Encoder-Design-and-Implementation-on-FPGA

## Encoder Design of Reed Solomon Code
### Code Block Size (255,239) Bytes
### Total Parity of 16 Bytes
### 2t = 16Bytes, total of 8 Bytes of Errors can be Corrected at the receiver's end.
### Symbol Size of 8 bits so with every clock cycle 1 byte of data is being Processed
** so Total of 255 clock cycle is required to Generate Complete Block of Codeword.

## Reed Solomon Error Correcting Codes

Reed-Solomon (RS) codes have been in use for several decades and have been widely adopted in various communication systems, including satellite communication.
Type of (n,k) Block Code, (n,k) t-error correcting code

### RS Encoding
*** Input
* Message Bits  :  m = [m(0),m(1),m(2),……..m(k-1)]
*
