# Reed_solomon-Encoder-Design-and-Implementation-on-FPGA

## Encoder Design of Reed Solomon Code
### Code Block Size (255,239) Bytes
### Total Parity of 16 Bytes
### 2t = 16Bytes, total of 8 Bytes of Errors can be Corrected at the receiver's end.
### Symbol Size of 8 bits so with every clock cycle 1 byte of data is being Processed
*** so Total of 255 clock cycle is required to Generate Complete Block of Codeword.
